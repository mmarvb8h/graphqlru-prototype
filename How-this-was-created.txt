I USED THIS METHOD TO RUN RAILS 5.2.1
From: https://medium.com/@relativkreativ/how-to-manage-multiple-rails-versions-bf5759d0823b


I already had rbenv, bundler, and ruby installed.

PREPARE DIRECTORY FOR RAILS VERSION 5.2.1

The below creates a folder for ur app.
Then create a gemfile with just the rails version i want.
Then run bundle install to install the rails version
    for bundler's use (instead of one global version).
This also updates Gemfile with needed rails dependencies.

$> cd /tmp/rails-apps
$> mkdir my-first-app
$> cd my-first-app
$> echo "source 'https://rubygems.org'" > Gemfile
$> echo "gem 'rails', '5.2.1'" >> Gemfile
$> bundle install


CREATE NEW RAILS APPLICATION:

Using the rails version in the gemfile above, creates
    the rails application drirectory structure. Using the
    --force flag over-writes the above Gemfile creating above
    new Gemfile with all the necessary dependencies for above
    base application. Some suff is defaults (like sqlite)
    needs to chg.
    
$> bundle exec rails new . --force --skip-bundle
$> bundle update
